Description: Computes a novel metric of affinity between two entities based on their co-occurrence 
  (using binary presence/absence data). The metric and its MLE, alpha hat, were advanced in 
  Mainali, Slud, et al, 2021 <doi:10.1126/sciadv.abj9204>. Various types of confidence intervals and median interval
  were developed in Mainali and Slud, 2022 <doi:10.1101/2022.11.01.514801>.
